In the directory Alison_code, you can find detailed implementation of data cleaning. Each ipynb file deals with one column (see file name). Here, STREET2 column did not have any code because there was only about 20-30 misspellings, so I corrected them by hand.

In the directory Jennie_code:
1. LegalStatusUpdate.csv: it is a map between certain ocupations and their corresponding legal statuses.
2. LegalStatusUpdate.xlsx: it's the same with the 'LegalStatusUpdate.csv'.
3. Occupation.ipynb: clean the column 'OCUPATION1','OCUPATION2','OCUPATION3',and output â€œLEGALSTATUS1","STATUSINFO1","LEGALSTATUS2","STATUSINFO2","LEGALSTATUS3","STATUSINFO3"
4. PortandAddress.ipynb: clean the column 'PORT' and split it into new column "PORT(CITY)" and "PORT(STATE)"; clean the column 'STREET1', 'CITY1', 'STATE1'.
